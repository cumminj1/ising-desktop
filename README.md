# ising-desktop

Lattice.py is the primary file, where lat(_1) are purely for testing purposes
script.py is the script which imports and runs the module and associated class.


this is a computational version of the ising model, applied first to an NxM lattice,
with information about the lattice collected; magnetisiation, mag susceptibility,
heat capacity, and total energy of the lattice. have collected graphs for each of these
quantities over a range of temperatures. Code is now to be adapted as a formal investiagtion
into a scientific topic, utilising the ising model as a tool.

cannot figure out why code runs when imported in script.py
